    VOLUNTEERS PERFORM THE FUNCTIONAL ACT OF TRANSFORMING FOOD WASTE.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a volunteer, you can take part in our Cooking Shifts, transforming food waste into nutritious and enjoyable meals for our clients. In this way, you play an essential role in our mission to simultaneously combat food waste and food insecurity, repurposing foods and diverting waste. We rely on volunteers for every Cooking Shift, and we encourage anyone to try it out &#8212; no cooking experience required!
  </p>

  <p>
    <b class="homeHeading-2">WHAT:</b>
    <br>
    Volunteers help our Shift Captains on Cooking Shifts prepare food for our clients. Volunteers
    can help with any task in the kitchen, including deciding what to cook, preparing meat, and chopping vegetables.
    Cooking Shifts are scheduled for two hours, but generally last from an hour to an hour and a half.
