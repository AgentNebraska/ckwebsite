    OUR EVENTS SPREAD AWARENESS AND PROMOTE EXCITEMENT FOR OUR MISSION.
  </p>
  <p>
    We regularly hold especially publicized events to invite as many members of the WashU community to participate in and support our efforts to feed St. Louis. Look out for our advertising to join in the festivities!

      <b class="homeHeading-2">PIE CARAMBA</b>
      <p> Volunteers in groups of up to four can sign up to bake two pies in our kitchen. They take one home, and we donate the other to our clients. At Pie Caramba, anyone can rejoice in the spirit of Thanksgiving with a group of friends and share that spirit with those in need. We provide the ingredients and the equipment, so volunteers only have to show up ready to make a difference! This event normally occurs late in the fall semester. </p>

    <p>
      Pizza Palooza mirrors Pie Caramba, but with pizza pies! Volunteers arrive to bake two pizzas: one to take home and one to donate. Volunteers can try their hand at pizza making while feeding our community. This event normally occurs late in the spring semester.

    <p> Raise the Dough is an annual fundraiser to support our functions as a student organization, including buying food items for cooking shifts and paying for kitchen supplies. Shift Captains handcraft specialty glazes to prepare donuts for purchase at our tables in BD and the DUC. In the past, our flavors have included Oreo, Matcha, Coffee, Strawberry, and Nutella. Every purchase supports our mission to feed St. Louis!
